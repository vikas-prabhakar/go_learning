/*
Calculate how many seconds are in a year.

 STEPS:

 1. Declare secPerDay constant and initialize it to the number of seconds in a day

 2. Declare daysYear constant and initialize it to 365

 3. Use fmt.Printf() to print out the total number of seconds in a year.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:

There are 31536000 seconds in a year.
